# What is TARS

TARS is a new generation distributed microservice applications framework that was created in 2008. It provides developers and enterprises with a complete set of solutions to build, release, deploy and maintain stable and reliable applications that run at scale.

In June 2018, TARS joined the Linux Foundation umbrella and became one of its projects. On March 10th, 2020, it was announced that the TARS Project will transition into the TARS Foundation,

“a neutral home for open source microservices projects that empower any industry to quickly turn ideas into applications at scale”.

The TARS Foundation’s goal is to address the most common problems related to microservices application, including solving multi-programming language interoperability issues, mitigating transfer issues, maintaining consistency of data storage, and ensuring high performance while supporting a growing number of requests.

TARS framework has been successfully used by many companies from diverse industries such as fintech, esports, edge computing, online streaming, e-commerce and education, to name a few.

## Ecosystem Components: Infrastructure

TARS is working in PaaS. It can be run on physical machines, virtual machines and containers, including Docker and Kubernetes.

## Ecosystem Components: Storage

TARS service data can be stored in cache, DB or a file system based on your status.

- For cache, you can use Redis or DCache (a distributed, in-memory NoSQL system which is based on the TARS framework), etc.
- For DB, you can use MySQL, MariaDB, etc.
- For file systems, you can use Ceph, HDFS, etc.
