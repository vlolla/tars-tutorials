# Building Microservice Platforms with TARS

TARS is a new generation distributed Microservice Applications framework designed to support
multiple programming languages, including C++, Golang, Java, Node.js, PHP, and Python,
which allows developers and enterprises to quickly build stable and reliable applications that run
at scale.

The framework has been developed and solidified for more than ten years, and it has been
widely used by more than 120 companies from different industries.

TARS became an open source project under the Linux Foundation umbrella in June 2018, and
to date the scale of microservices has reached one million, perfecting the practice of the
industry-standard DevOps philosophy and mass service approach.

The course is an introduction to microservices and the TARS framework for beginners. Through
the course, you will understand the concepts of monolith, microservices, serverless, and service
mesh, and how their differences translate into the different approaches for software
development. For instance, you will learn about how TARS differs from service mesh
applications such as Istio. You will also learn about the powerful functionalities of TARS and the components that make up the TARS ecosystem. Further, by installing the TARS framework with
different approaches, you will get a sense of container orchestration, namely Docker and
Kubernetes, and their differences from TARS. Ultimately, you will be prepared to develop your
services using TARS along with the many useful tips provided by the course.
